# Setting up the enviroment

To run this project, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the required packages. You can do this using either Conda or pip:

## Option 1: Using Conda
Conda is a package and environment manager. It can recreate the exact environment this project was developed in. Here's how to do it:

Clone the project:
'''
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
'''

Navigate to the project directory:
'''
cd your_project
'''

Create a new Conda environment from the environment.yml file:
'''
conda env create -f environment.yml
'''

Activate the new environment:
'''
conda activate your_env_name
'''
